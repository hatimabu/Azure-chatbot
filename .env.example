# Copy this file to .env and add your actual API key
# NEVER commit the .env file to GitHub!

# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# That's it! This simple version only needs one key.
# As you expand, you'll add more:
# DATABASE_URL=
# AZURE_KEY=
# etc.
